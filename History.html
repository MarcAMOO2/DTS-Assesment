    <div class="infomation">
    <p>Video Games were first invented in 1950s and 1960s when computer scientists started developing simple games and simulations on a mainframe computer in 1962 as one of the first such games to be played with a video display.</p>
    <p>The early <strong>1970s</strong> brought the first consumer-ready video game hardware: the first home video game console, the <strong>Magnavox Odyssey</strong>, and the first arcade video games, <strong> Space and Pong</strong>, the latter which was later made into a home console version.</p>
    <p>Due to this, multiple companies came up to try and capture Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by creating many clones of the game, this caused a series of boom and bust cycles due to "oversaturation and lack of innovation". The next reported major event regarding video games was the large growth of computer games</p>

<h2>Progression of Video Games and how they Developed over the years</h2>
<h2>1970s</h2>
<p>Through out the 1970s, many events (that were recorded) occured through out this decade, are as is: The development of Mainframe Computer Games, The first creation of Arcade Video Games and Home Consoles, this caused the next event which was the creation of a dedicated console market. What was next consitered a event was "Growth of video game arcades and the golden age". Then later down the line was Introduction to cartridge based home consoles and the final recorded event was The First, Handheld LED/VFD/LCD games</p>
<hr>
<h2>1980s</h2>
<p>A majour event that had occured in the 1980s decade was the Video Game Crash of 1983, you can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games#Video_game_crash_of_1983">here</a> but i will summarise it,
 The first major problem contributing to the Crash was an absurd over saturation in the video game console market in North America. By 1983, gamers had dozens of console choices to pick from. This created a situation of confusion for the average customer. Each console came with its own set of games from the company that manufactured it, as well as an expansive web of third-party games.
 <hr>
 <h2>1990s</h2>
<p>Society had a swap to optical media, then the introduction to 3D graphics, the resurgence and the rapid decline of arcades. These were the only real 'impactful' events that occured through out 1990s</p>
<hr>
<h2>2000s</h2>
<p>The change of home consoles landscape was altered, this was a very small change but it changed the idea of making home consoles in the future, something dramatic that happened in the 2000s was the rise and usage of mobile games and mobile gaming, a "sport" type called ESports was invented, A new genre of games called MMO or more often called MMORPG stands for massively multiplayer online role-playing games or RPG (stands for Role playing Game)
The larger use of online services was invented (like Ebay and Amazon type of online services), the more increased production of browser, casual and social games was made.  The AAA (Triple A) video game industry and the emergence of indie games, a indie game is short for individual game and is often made by a solo dev or a small group of devs to work on a game. </p>
<hr>
<h2>2010s</h2>
<p>The introduction to <strong>High Definition Graphics</strong> in video game hardware, Game graphics have progressed vastly ever since the 2000s and 2010s and continually get better and better over the years. More acomplishments in online gaming: Cross-platform playable games and the introduction of cloud gaming (which allowed the user to play games without physically having them and using them through a connected pc using wifi and saves time from downloading games using cloud gaming). The new revenue models for video games, this means companies thinking more about addictive templates of games and the introduction of in-app purchases (which were/are very popular among the mobile gaming platforms), subscription based games such as MMOs, and the didgital distribution market led to new revenues for recurring revenue by treating games as a service (GaaS), The improved consoles of Mixed, Virtual and augmented reality games, because of the fairly recent addition to the gaming platforms known as VR (Virtual Reality) finally had more developers who would start producing/developing games for the VR systems making VR a 'more popular thing' </p>
<hr>
<h2>2020s</h2>
<p>The introduction, production and ability to use Ray-tracing and photorealistic graphics by using high-end, modern graphics and computer parts that allow this kind of content to be produced and viewed and also put into games making the present-future games extremely hyper-realistic. Another introduction that is fairly new as of 20/03/22 is The Metaverse, The Metaverse is a Virtual society being built, planned and constructed by Facebook, the idea behind the metaverse is to make doing work meetings easier and to sell cheaper vr systems to make the metaverse a more accessable place for the world to "live in". Blockchain and NFT Games, and video game acquisitions are now current through out 2020s, the infomation is very short since it is very recent into this decade.</p>
