    <p>Video Games were first invented in 1950s and 1960s when computer scientists started developing simple games and simulations on a mainframe computer in 1962 as one of the first such games to be played with a video display.</p>
    <p>The early <strong>1970s</strong> brought the first consumer-ready video game hardware: the first home video game console, the <strong>Magnavox Odyssey</strong>, and the first arcade video games, <strong> Space and Pong</strong>, the latter which was later made into a home console version.</p>
    <p>Due to this, multiple companies came up to try and capture Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by creating many clones of the game, this caused a series of boom and bust cycles due to "oversaturation and lack of innovation".</p>
